    <p>
      Cyclone spins at the player's attack speed and deals <a href="https://pathofexile.gamepedia.com/Area_of_effect" target="_blank">area of effect damage </a>
      twice per spin. When dual wielding, each weapon hits once per spin. While
      Cycloning, the player is immune to stun and knockback. Death, being
      frozen, and Bear Traps will still stop movement. Movement will also stop
      upon hitting an object. Characters can pass through enemies for the
      duration of the attack. Note that this is not considered Phasing.

      Theoretical maximum Area of effect
    </h3>

    <p>
      The absolute maximum self-sustained range possible for Cyclone as of
      version 3.0.0 is 66. It can be achieved by a Deadeye dual wielding
      triple-white-socket Prismatic Eclipse s, wearing all the gear and jewels
      that increase area, weapon range, or flask effects (including the relevant
      corruptions), speccing into the relevant passive skills, linking lv21 q20%
      Cyclone, lv4 Empower, lv4 Enhance, lv21 IAoE together in an Item with a +1
      to Level of Socketed Gems modifier and having Dying Sun active. The
      maximum range without using flasks is 80.
